      <em>Dear<br />J.M.A.</em>
    </p>
    <p class="main_text">
      It's unimaginable how many versions of this letter of written. I never
      thought I'd go back to letter-writing posts freshman year, but ive
      realized it's my favorite way to communicate when I feel a lot. Well, I'm
      not sure if this is categorized as a letter considering I coded it online,
      but whatever I don't care. I'm not as poetically gifted with words as you
      are, my talents lie more in imagery and web stuff, so bare with me. All of
      the prior versions of this letter were just riddled with endless rambles
      and a bunch of “I Want,” statements, but I know what I want. Looking back
      on our relationship, I didn't think it would end like this. When I sought
      to write a refined version of this letter I had so much to say, each day a
      new question would cross my mind, and I’d think to write it down, but I
      knew if I did it would just remind me of you. <br /><br />I went to the
      airport to catch my flight to Houston for Thanksgiving and next to my gate
      was a flight to Chicago, the same gate I took when I came to Chicago and
      the same gate I came out of when I returned. As much as I want to push you
      out of my mind, everything keeps reminding me of you. The cool metal of
      your ring and the mistaken scribbles on your letters. When I returned, for
      days I could not bring myself to unpack my duffle bag, because I knew once
      I did it meant I had to face all the memories buried in the fabric of the
      clothes. The good ones, the movie, the party, devouring the pasta on the
      floor. And the bad ones, the breakup, crying in front of random
      Northwestern students, the breakfast. Even the bittersweet ones, the
      beach, the bike ride. I hated how normal...almost relieved you became when
      you finally ripped the bandaid off and broke up with me, but maybe you
      were just protecting yourself. Or maybe you were happy to finally let me
      go. <br /><br />Having to face how I was treated and how I felt during the
      relationship was one of the hardest things. Crying over something I wish I
      could have, even though I probably shouldn't have wanted it was worse.
      Through all of it, I loved you. Most confusing of all? The aftermath, the
      daily LinkedIn views, the Instagram views from the Northwestern Page,
      <em>I noticed that</em>, the red bulls. Why all of this now? And why did I
      hold all of them so dear to my heart? I dont want to let you go, I don't
      want you out of my life, even through all of this, I still want you. A
      part of me wished, youd appear at my doorstep telling me this was all a
      joke, but the other half knows thats not true.<br /><br />
      The act of loving is so selfless, I want this to be my one selfish act. I
      want this to serve as your constant reminder of me. Is it selfish of me to
      want you to never forget me? Potentially. Maybe I’m an inherently
      <strong>selfish</strong> person or maybe I just love you too much. Years
      down the line, when we are so much older and youve taken off my ring,
      buried my Polaroids deep in your closet, and removed my bracelet. I still
      want this to be a lasting memory, but I know you'll find someone, who
      you'll deem worthy enough, someone you'll jump through hoops for,
      something who through everything you'll <strong>love</strong>. I just wish
      it were me.
